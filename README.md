# Vehicle Detection and Counting Tracker

## Overview
This project is a computer vision application designed to detect and count vehicles passing through a designated area in real time. Using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, this application efficiently tracks vehicles and counts the number of cars passing through a predefined polygonal area.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLO (You Only Look Once)
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- Custom Tracker

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects and counts vehicles as they pass through specified areas.
- **Polygonal Area Definition**: Users can define the tracking area using coordinates.
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Tracks individual vehicles using a tracking algorithm.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the number of vehicles passing through the area in real time.

## Usage Guide

### Installation
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application

1.Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssaf-Mohamed/Vehicle-Detection-Tracker.git
