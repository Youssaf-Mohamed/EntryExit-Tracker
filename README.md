# People Counting System for Market Entry and Exit

## Project Overview
This project implements a computer vision solution to count the number of people entering and exiting a market in real-time. Utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, this system provides valuable insights into foot traffic patterns.

## Features
- **Real-time People Detection**: Detects individuals using the YOLOv8 model.
- **Counting Mechanism**: Accurately counts the number of people entering and exiting the market.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the current count of entering and exiting individuals on the screen.

## Requirements
- Python 
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 model
- NumPy
- Tracker (custom tracking implementation)

### Installation
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Application

1.Clone the repository:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Youssaf-Mohamed/EntryExit-Tracker.git
